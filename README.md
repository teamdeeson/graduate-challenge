# Deeson Technical Challenge.

This is the technical test we set during technical recruitment.

## Editing the repository.

1. Edit the markdown files.
2. Check it works locally by running `make start`
3. Push files to the repo, they will be built and deployed to a [Github pages account](https://github.com/teamdeeson/technical-challenge)

## Debugging.

If you need to debug, you can run a local build with `make build` which runs in a Docker container and leaves you with a site directory of the files that would have been deployed to Github.
