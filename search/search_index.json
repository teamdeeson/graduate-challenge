This is to asses your HTML, CSS and JavaScript abilities.\n\n\nFollowing submission we'll be asking you questions about your approach, choices and what you might have had to learn to complete the assignment in the technical interview.\n\n\n1. Coding 'out of the box' to an unconventional assignment\n\n\nDownload posters.zip\n\n\nIn the attached zip file there is a collection of posters, please pick one and reproduce it using just HTML and CSS (no images), it does not need to be responsive, but it should look correct in the latest Chrome and Firefox;\n\n\n2. Writing a small Javascript React app\n\n\nFor this task you will create a React app containing a functional stopwatch. The stopwatch will have the following features:\n\n\n\n\nTime display: The current elapsed time in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)\n\n\nStart button: A button to start or continue a timer.\n\n\nPause button: A button to pause the running timer.\n\n\nReset button: A button to reset the timer to zero.\n\n\n\n\nThe application should use \nReactJS\n for the display of the user interface.\n\n\nThe application code should be hosted in a version control repository on GitHub.\n\n\nThe application should have a README.md in the project root that describes how to get the project running on a local development environment.\n\n\nBonus points:\n\n\n\n\nLap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed.\n\n\nClear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history\n\n\nMake it look good\n\n\nNo bugs or quirky behaviour... (does it keep good time? If you leave it running for an hour has it drifted significantly? Can you stop this from happening?)\n\n\nHave the application build using \nGithib actions\n\n\nHost the application online using \nGithub pages\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\nWe will only be testing this in Chrome.\n\n\nThese are intended to give us a feel for how you work as a developer and your level of experience and technical ability.\n\n\n\n\nWhere to send to\n\n\nWhen you are done, please send a link to your GitHub repo and any covering notes to our Technical Director, John Ennew - \njohne@deeson.co.uk",
